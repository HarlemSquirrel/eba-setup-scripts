# EBA Setup Scripts
A set of shell scripts to set up student Ubuntu Linux clients at EBA

I developed these BASH scripts to improve the process of deploying Ubuntu Linux clients at my school.

# eba-setup
This script sets up a fresh install of Edubuntu 12.04/14.04. The admin account is expected to be `eba`

# installWiFidrivers
This script installs wireless drivers for Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 behind the NYC DOE Proxy server

# loaner-setup
This script setups up loaner devices by allowing all users to connect to WiFi and creating desktop shortcuts to control the proxy settings

# ProxyEBA and ProxyOff
These scripts configure the proxy settings for connecting to the Internet at EBA or elsewhere respectively.

# pupil-setup
This script configures settings for a `pupil` user for Edubuntu 12.04/14.04
